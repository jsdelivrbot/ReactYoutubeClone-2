# React Youtube Clone

Small Youtube clone using React and Webpack, comes with search and watch video functionality.

In order to run this example, you need to get a Google API Key for Youtube API.
You also need a Google account to access [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/), request an API Key and enable Youtube API v3 on your Google Developers Console account.

Once you get your API Key, go to `index.js` file, line 8 and replace the empty string `""` with your API Key, like so:

```
const API_KEY = "MyGoogleAPIKey";
```

After that, you're ready to run the example from the command line:

```
npm install && npm start
```
